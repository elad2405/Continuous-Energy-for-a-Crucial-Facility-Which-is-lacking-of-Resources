# Continuous energy for a crucial facility which is lacking of resources


## Intriduction : 
1. Renewable energy systems are a crucial step against climate change and global warming
2. Renewable energy sources are getting cheaper and are more available
3. Renewable energy systems allow fully autonomous and local control of the power supply, using mini-grids
4. Renewable energy mini-grids allow economic efficiency under variety of constraints

## Goals : 

1. Minimize the total cost required for a complete renewable energy mini-grid 
    - Consists of 100% renewable energy, including generation and storage 
    - Continuous operation under various weather and power demand conditions

## Conclusions : 
1. Energy matching method leads to more realistic costs
2. With sufficient duration of time (~30 ùë¶ùëíùëéùëüùë†), our solution is more beneficial for down to inflation value of 0.925
3. Our optimization reached significantly cheaper operating cost, but the capital cost was more expensive
4. It is more beneficial to optimize over operating cost, rather than capital cost
5. It might be helpful to partially use our analysis, and add more green energy source if possible

# Matlab 
-  Verify that version 9.5 (R2018b) of the MATLAB is installed or newer. 
-  Run main.m file
### Explanations: 
1. This matlab application uses data from csv files. 
	- Make sure that all the csv files are on the same path of the project.
2. The user can decide if to use local data or import their own.
3. In order to do so, the csv files need to be in the right formart, which is specified in [Report](https://github.com/elad2405/Continuous-Energy-for-a-Crucial-Facility-Which-is-lacking-of-Resources/blob/main/Final%20report%20-%20V2.3.5.pdf) , at appendix 6.
